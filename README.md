## Professional Experience

### Senior Research Support Specialist  
**The Research Foundation for SUNY â€“ Albany NanoTech Complex, Albany, NY**  
*May 2025 â€“ Present*  
- Researched **chemically amplified resists (CARs)** to evaluate efficiency and material response compared to **ESCAP resists** under different exposure conditions.  
- Investigated **photoacid generator (PAG) outgassing behavior** in CAR resists and correlated findings with process stability and resist performance.  
- Collaborated with etch engineers to study **Hâ‚‚ plasma etching** of CAR resists, examining etch selectivity, surface modification, and film retention.  
- Extracted the **bandgap of CAR resist polymers** using **X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)** and analyzed spectra with **CasaXPS** to interpret electronic structures.  
- Worked with cross-functional teams to install and validate an **in-situ heated environment** for the **ERIC electron-beam exposure tool**, enabling precise temperature-controlled experiments.  
- Analyzed experimental data using Excel and LabVIEW, preparing technical reports and presentations for R&D collaboration meetings.

### Senior Research Aide  
**The Research Foundation for SUNY â€“ Albany NanoTech Complex, Albany, NY**  
*September 2024 â€“ April 2025*  
- Conducted research on **dry-develop techniques** for chemically amplified resists (CARs) under **EUV exposure** conditions.  
- Performed **exposure, post-exposure bake, and development** steps to analyze resist contrast, cross-linking behavior, and pattern retention.  
- Investigated **thin film deposition** on exposed resist surfaces to study interfacial modification and molecular interaction effects.  
- Developed and optimized **oxygen plasma etch recipes** (50â€“300 W, 10â€“100 mTorr) to evaluate resist etch resistance and process stability.  
- Collected and analyzed process data to correlate **exposure, bake, and etch parameters** with resist performance metrics.  

### Research Assistant  
**College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering â€“ University at Albany, Albany, NY**  
*May 2024 â€“ August 2024*  
- Designed and implemented an **asynchronous FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) buffer in **Verilog** for cross-clock domain communication.  
- Integrated multiple FIFOs between memory and a **systolic array** to manage clock speed variations and prevent data loss.  
- Conducted extensive **functional verification** using GTKWave to ensure data integrity and correct signal timing.  
- Researched **hardware security vulnerabilities** by simulating Trojan injections and manipulating read/write pointer logic.

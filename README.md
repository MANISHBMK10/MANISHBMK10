# Hi there, I’m Manish Kumar Badamoni 👋

## About Me

I’m an **IP / Design Verification Engineer** at the **Research Foundation for SUNY**, with ~**1.5 years of hands-on experience** in **functional verification, ASIC design, and CPU architecture**.

My work focuses on building **UVM-based verification environments**, applying **assertion-based and coverage-driven verification**, and validating **AXI-based IPs and CDC-intensive designs**. I enjoy working at the intersection of **verification, RTL design, and computer architecture**.

I’m interested in opportunities as a **Design Verification Engineer / IP Verification Engineer**, where I can contribute to the verification of complex, high-performance hardware systems.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### IP Verification Engineer  
**The Research Foundation for SUNY – Albany, NY**  
*September 2024 – Present*  

- Developed **reusable UVM-based verification environments** for **AXI memory IPs**, supporting configurable address/data widths and protocol variations.  
- Implemented **constrained-random and directed tests**, assertions, and functional coverage to validate **read/write channels, bursts, and error responses**.  
- Closed functional coverage through iterative test refinement and validated **protocol behavior under reset and backpressure scenarios**.

### FPGA Intern  
**University at Albany – Albany, NY**  
*May 2024 – August 2024*  

- Designed and implemented an **asynchronous FIFO** in **SystemVerilog** for cross-clock domain communication.  
- Integrated multiple FIFOs between memory and a **systolic array accelerator** to handle clock-rate mismatches.  
- Performed **UVM-based functional verification** with assertions, achieving **100% functional coverage** across FIFO full/empty conditions, pointer synchronization, and CDC corner cases.

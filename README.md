## Professional Experience

### Senior Research Aide  
**The Research Foundation for SUNY Albany NanoTech Complex, Albany, NY**  
*September 2024 â€“ Present*  
- Research on dry development techniques for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.  
- Developing EUV resist formulations, spin coating, and electron exposure techniques.  
- Optimizing oxygen plasma etch processes through experiments to measure resist loss and analyze outgassing properties.

### Research Assistant  
**College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering, University at Albany, Albany, NY**  
*May 2024 â€“ August 2024*  
- Designed and implemented an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer in Verilog for cross-clock domain communication.  
- Integrated multiple FIFOs between memory and a systolic array to manage clock speed variations and prevent data loss.  
- Conducted in-depth verification using GTKWave simulations to analyze signal integrity and debug timing issues.  
- Researched hardware security vulnerabilities by simulating Trojan injections and manipulating read/write pointers.

## Course Projects

### Optimizing Develop-free Resist in Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography  
*February 2025 - Present*  
- Researching resist material stability and behavior under high-vacuum and thermal processing conditions for EUV lithography.  
- Evaluating non-develop resist materials that evaporate without liquid processing to improve pattern fidelity.  
- Analyzing molecular outgassing and residues to identify low-contamination resist candidates.

### Systolic Array Accelerator | Cadence XCelium  
*February 2024 - March 2024*  
- Designed a MAC (Multiply and Accumulate) unit and an 8-bit 4Ã—4 matrix multiplier by utilizing 16 MAC instances for efficient matrix computations.  
- Developed the matrix multiplier in Verilog for simulation in Cadence, ensuring proper synchronization.

### Design of an Asynchronous Integer Arithmetic and Logic Processor | Xilinx, FPGA  
*April 2024*  
- Developed a binary arithmetic and logic processor for performing integer operations.  
- Created a custom IP in Vivado IP Integrator block design and integrated it into a larger system for efficient data processing.  
- Utilized VHDL to design user-defined IP blocks, ensuring modularity and scalability within the Vivado environment.

# Hi there, I’m Manish Kumar Badamoni 👋

## About Me

I’m an **IP / Design Verification Engineer** at the **Research Foundation for SUNY**, with ~**1.5 years of hands-on experience** in **functional verification, ASIC design, and CPU architecture**.

My work focuses on building **UVM-based verification environments**, applying **assertion-based and coverage-driven verification**, and validating **AXI-based IPs designs**. I enjoy working at the intersection of **verification, RTL design, and computer architecture**.

I’m interested in opportunities as a **Design Verification Engineer / IP Verification Engineer**, where I can contribute to the verification of complex, high-performance hardware systems.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### IP Verification Engineer  
**The Research Foundation for SUNY – Albany, NY**  
*September 2024 – Present*  

- Built a **configurable UVM-based verification environment** for an **AXI memory subsystem**, supporting multi-agent traffic from multiple masters through arbitration logic to AXI slave interfaces.
- Developed **constrained-random and directed test sequences** with **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)** to validate AXI protocol compliance, including burst handling, transaction ordering, backpressure propagation, and reset scenarios.
- Implemented **functional and cross-coverage models** to track protocol states and corner cases, and achieved coverage closure through iterative test refinement and stress testing.

### FPGA Intern  
**University at Albany – Albany, NY**  
*May 2024 – August 2024*  

- Designed and implemented an **asynchronous FIFO** in **SystemVerilog** for cross-clock domain communication.  
- Integrated multiple FIFOs between memory and a **systolic array accelerator** to handle clock-rate mismatches.  
- Performed **UVM-based functional verification** with assertions, achieving **100% functional coverage** across FIFO full/empty conditions, pointer synchronization, and CDC corner cases.

## Projects

### Systolic Array Accelerator (TPU-Inspired Architecture)
- Designed a **pipelined systolic array** using 16 MAC units for 4×4, 8-bit matrix multiplication.
- Verified functional correctness and timing using **Cadence Xcelium**.

### Cache and Memory Hierarchy Simulator
- Built a configurable **C++ simulator** for a two-level (L1/L2) cache hierarchy.
- Evaluated performance using **100,000+ memory access traces** across varying cache configurations.

### Verification of Communication Protocols
- Designed and verified **SPI, I2C, and UART** protocols using **SystemVerilog and UVM**.
- Built structured testbenches and documented verification flows.
